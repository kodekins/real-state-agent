# Listing Display Fix - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Duplicate Announcements** ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Avatar was announcing listings twice
- Once from API `avatarSpeech` field
- Again from `useEffect` in frontend

**Solution:** Removed the duplicate `useEffect` announcement. Now avatar only speaks once from the API response.

### 2. **Avatar Speech Updated** üì¢
**Old:** "You can see all the details on the screen below. Would you like to know more?"

**New:** "Please have a look at the listings below according to your needs. You can click on any property to see full details."

### 3. **Server 404 Errors** üîß
**Problem:** Multiple 404 errors causing page load issues

**Solution:** 
- Killed all node processes
- Restarted development server fresh

## How It Works Now

### Flow:
```
1. User asks: "Show me condos in Toronto"
   ‚Üì
2. API processes request & fetches listings
   ‚Üì
3. Avatar speaks: "I found X properties that match your search. 
   The top result is a 2-bedroom condo in Toronto for $899,000. 
   Please have a look at the listings below according to your needs."
   ‚Üì
4. Listings display on screen
   ‚Üì
5. User can click properties for details
```

```

‚úÖ No duplicate announcements

## What Changed in Code

### `pages/api/chat.js`
```javascript
// Updated avatarSpeech to include:
avatarSpeech += `Please have a look at the ${count === 1 ? 'listing' : 'listings'} below according to your needs. You can click on any property to see full details.`;
```

### `pages/index.js`
```javascript
// Removed duplicate announcement useEffect

# 🔧 Final Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. ✅ Commercial vs Residential Detection
**Problem:** Always searched for "Residential" even when user asked for "commercial"

**Solution:** 
- Added `propertyCategory` detection in `extractSearchParams()`
- Detects keywords: commercial, business, retail, office
- Query now uses:
  - `PropertyType eq 'Commercial'` when commercial requested
  - `PropertyType eq 'Residential'` for houses/condos

**Example:**
```
User: "Show me commercial properties in Toronto"
→ PropertyType eq 'Commercial' ✅

User: "Show me condos in Toronto"  
→ PropertyType eq 'Residential' ✅
```

### 2. ✅ AI Responds Based on Results
**Problem:** AI didn't tell user when no listings were found

**Solution:**
- AI now receives context about listing count
- **When listings found:** AI presents them with MLS numbers, prices, addresses
- **When no listings:** AI tells user "no properties match your criteria" and suggests:
  1. Broaden search (different area, price, type)
  2. Set up alerts
  3. Call Andrew at 416-882-9304

**Example:**

**With Results:**
```
✅ Found 15 properties from AMPRE

AI: "I found 15 commercial properties in Toronto! Here are some excellent options:

1. MLS# A00123456 - Commercial space at $750,000
2. MLS# W98765432 - Retail location at $1,200,000
...

Contact me at 416-882-9304 to schedule viewings!"
```

**No Results:**
```
✅ Found 0 properties from AMPRE

AI: "I couldn't find any commercial properties in Toronto matching your criteria right now. 

Let me help you:
1. Would you like to expand to nearby areas?
2. I can set up alerts when matching properties become available
3. Call me at 416-882-9304 to discuss your specific needs"
```

## What Changed in Code:

### `pages/api/chat.js`:

**1. Property Category Detection:**
```javascript
// NEW: Detects commercial vs residential
if (messageLower.includes('commercial') || messageLower.includes('business') || 
    messageLower.includes('retail') || messageLower.includes('office')) {
  params.propertyCategory = 'commercial';
} else {
  params.propertyCategory = 'residential';
}
```

**2. Dynamic PropertyType:**
```javascript
// NEW: Uses detected category
if (searchParams.propertyCategory === 'commercial') {
  filterConditions.push("PropertyType eq 'Commercial'");
} else {
  filterConditions.push("PropertyType eq 'Residential'");
}
```

**3. AI Context:**
```javascript
// NEW: Tells AI about results
if (listingsData.listings.length > 0) {
  conversationHistory += `AVAILABLE LISTINGS (${listingsData.count} found):\n...`;
  conversationHistory += `Present these listings to the user...`;
} else {
  conversationHistory += `NO LISTINGS FOUND: No properties match...`;
  conversationHistory += `Suggest alternatives...`;
}
```

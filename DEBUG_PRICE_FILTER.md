# 🐛 Price Filter Debug Guide

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### Changed Operators:
```javascript
// BEFORE:
ListPrice le 2000000  // Less than or Equal
ListPrice ge 500000   // Greater than or Equal

// AFTER:
ListPrice lt 2000000  // Less Than (strict)
ListPrice gt 500000   // Greater Than (strict)
```

This matches your working Postman query!

### Added Debug Logging:
Now you'll see exactly what's happening:

```
💰 Max price filter: ListPrice lt 1000
🔍 All filter conditions: ["PropertyType eq 'Residential'", "ListPrice lt 1000", "StandardStatus eq 'Active'"]
📡 Full OData query: $filter=PropertyType eq 'Residential' and ListPrice lt 1000 and StandardStatus eq 'Active'
🌐 Complete API URL: https://query.ampre.ca/odata/Property?$filter=...
✅ Fetched 0 properties from AMPRE
💵 First 5 property prices: []
```

---

## 🧪 Test Now

**1. Restart server:**
```bash
Ctrl+C
npm run dev
```

**2. Clear browser console (F12)**

**3. Ask: "Show me properties under $1000"**

**4. Check console for:**

### What You Should See:
```
🤖 Property search detected, extracting parameters...
✅ AI extracted parameters: {
  propertyCategory: 'residential',
  maxPrice: 1000      ← AI understood correctly!
}
💰 Max price filter: ListPrice lt 1000      ← Filter being applied!
🔍 All filter conditions: [
  "PropertyType eq 'Residential'",
  "ListPrice lt 1000",              ← Price filter is there!
  "StandardStatus eq 'Active'"
]
📡 Full OData query: $filter=PropertyType eq 'Residential' and ListPrice lt 1000 and StandardStatus eq 'Active'
✅ Fetched 0 properties from AMPRE    ← Expected! No properties under $1000
💵 First 5 property prices: []
```

### If Still Showing Wrong Prices:

The console will now show you:
1. **What the AI extracted** - Is maxPrice correct?
2. **What filter was built** - Is "ListPrice lt 1000" in the filter?
3. **What the API returned** - Are the actual prices shown?

## 🔍 Debugging Different Scenarios

### Test 1: Realistic Price
```
"Show me properties under $2 million"
```

**Expected Console:**
```
💰 Max price filter: ListPrice lt 2000000
💵 First 5 property prices: [799000, 1349000, 1899000, 1650000, 1750000]
```

All prices should be < $2,000,000 ✅

### Test 2: Unrealistic Price
```
"Show me properties under $1000"
```

**Expected Console:**
```
💰 Max price filter: ListPrice lt 1000
✅ Fetched 0 properties from AMPRE
💵 First 5 property prices: []
```

No properties found (correct!) ✅

### Test 3: Price Range
```
"Show me properties between $500k and $1M"
```

**Expected Console:**
```
💰 Min price filter: ListPrice gt 500000
💰 Max price filter: ListPrice lt 1000000
💵 First 5 property prices: [799000, 650000, 850000, 725000, 899000]
```

All prices should be > $500,000 and < $1,000,000 ✅

## 🎯 What the Logs Tell You

### If maxPrice is Wrong:
```
✅ AI extracted parameters: {maxPrice: 1000000}  ← Should be 1000!
```
→ Problem: AI misunderstood "$1000"

### If Filter Not Applied:
```
🔍 All filter conditions: [
  "PropertyType eq 'Residential'",
  "StandardStatus eq 'Active'"
]
← Missing: "ListPrice lt 1000"
```
→ Problem: searchParams.maxPrice is null or undefined

### If API Returns Wrong Prices:
```
💵 First 5 property prices: [799000, 1349000, 115000]
← These are > $1000!
```
→ Problem: AMPRE API not respecting the filter

## 🚨 If Problem Persists

**Send me these console logs:**
1. ✅ AI extracted parameters
2. 💰 Price filter
3. 🔍 All filter conditions
4. 📡 Full OData query
5. 💵 First 5 property prices

This will show me exactly where the issue is!

## 📋 Expected Behavior

### Query: "Properties under $1000"
- AI extracts: `maxPrice: 1000`
- Filter: `ListPrice lt 1000`
- Result: 0 properties (correct - nothing that cheap!)

### Query: "Properties under $2M"
- AI extracts: `maxPrice: 2000000`
- Filter: `ListPrice lt 2000000`
- Result: Many properties under $2M

### Query: "Properties between $800k and $1.5M"
- AI extracts: `minPrice: 800000, maxPrice: 1500000`
- Filter: `ListPrice gt 800000 and ListPrice lt 1500000`
- Result: Properties in that range
